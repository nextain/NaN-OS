  Testing strategy and lessons learned for Cafelua OS.
  Covers test pyramid, tooling, verification checklist, and anti-patterns discovered during development.

mirror: ".users/workflows/testing-strategy.md"

test_pyramid:
  unit:
    tool: vitest
    scope: "Pure functions, store logic, utility modules"
    examples:
      - "parseEmotion() returns correct emotion + cleanText"
      - "useChatStore addStreamingToolUse dedup check"
      - "encodeWav produces valid WAV header"
    speed: "< 1s per test"
    run: "pnpm --filter shell test"

  component:
    tool: "vitest + @testing-library/react + jsdom"
    scope: "React components in isolation with mocked dependencies"
    examples:
      - "ToolActivity renders status icon and tool name"
      - "SettingsModal saves enableTools to localStorage"
      - "ChatPanel renders tool_use chunks as ToolActivity"
    mocking:
      - "@tauri-apps/api/core → vi.mock with mockInvoke"
      - "@tauri-apps/api/event → vi.mock with mockListen"
      - "localStorage → jsdom built-in"
    gotchas:
      - "vi.resetModules() needed between tests that import same module with different mocks"
      - "vi.clearAllMocks() + vi.resetModules() in afterEach, NOT vi.restoreAllMocks()"
      - "Dynamic import (await import('../module')) when module has top-level side effects"

  integration:
    tool: "vitest (agent), cargo test (Rust)"
    scope: "Multi-module interactions, protocol compliance"
    examples:
      - "Gateway client connects, sends tool request, receives result"
      - "Gemini function calling: tool_call → execute → re-invoke → final text"
      - "Tauri gateway_health command returns status"

  e2e:
    tool: "cargo tauri build + manual verification"
    scope: "Full app launch, agent connection, visual confirmation"
    checklist:
      - "cargo tauri build succeeds (tsc + vite + cargo)"
      - "App window appears"
      - "Agent core starts (stdio connection)"
      - "Chat input functional"
      - "Settings modal opens/saves"
    note: "Automated E2E (tauri-driver/playwright) planned but not yet implemented"

tooling:
  test_runner: vitest
  component_testing: "@testing-library/react"
  dom_environment: jsdom
  linter: biome
  type_checker: "tsc -b (TypeScript project references)"
  build: "vite build (shell), cargo tauri build (full app)"
  formatter: "biome (tab, double quote, semicolons)"

verification_checklist:
  description: "Run these in order before every commit"
  steps:
    - cmd: "pnpm --filter shell test"
      expect: "All tests pass"
    - cmd: "pnpm --filter agent test"
      expect: "All tests pass"
    - cmd: "cd shell && pnpm run check"
      expect: "Biome: no errors"
    - cmd: "cd shell && pnpm run build"
      expect: "tsc + vite build clean"
    - cmd: "cd shell && cargo tauri build"
      expect: "Full Tauri app builds"
      note: "This is VERIFY step — don't skip"
    - cmd: "Launch built app"
      expect: "Window appears, agent connects"
      note: "Manual step — confirms real functionality"

code_review_process:
  description: "Multi-round review catches bugs that tests miss"
  rounds:
    round_1:
      focus: "CRITICAL issues — security, resource leaks, data loss"
      examples:
        - "Event listener leak on invoke() failure"
        - "No timeout for dangling listeners (resource leak)"
        - "Raw localStorage.getItem in render path (crash risk)"
    round_2:
      focus: "Confirm CRITICALs fixed + find MEDIUM issues"
      examples:
        - "enableTools:false dropped by falsy check"
        - "Missing CSS variables (--error) for dark themes"
        - "Button element missing CSS reset"
    round_3:
      focus: "SHOULD FIX — correctness edge cases"
      examples:
        - "Duplicate toolCallId not handled"
        - "Unknown toolCallId silently ignored"
        - "Boolean false dropped during save"

lessons_learned:
  phase_1:
    problem: "Skipped PLAN/CHECK/TDD, declared 'done' without running"
    result: "Bugs found by user, trust eroded"
    fix: "ALWAYS follow PLAN→CHECK→BUILD→VERIFY→CLEAN→COMMIT"

  phase_3_session_3:
    problem: "Jumped straight to BUILD, skipped process"
    result: "User caught it twice, had to retrofit code review + E2E"
    fix: "Read development-cycle.yaml at session start, no exceptions"

  vitest_module_caching:
    problem: "Test passes alone but fails in suite"
    cause: "Module-level mock state shared between tests"
    fix: "afterEach: vi.clearAllMocks() + vi.resetModules(). Use dynamic import."

  enabletools_false:
    problem: "Boolean false treated as falsy, dropped from config"
    cause: "enableTools && {...} / enableTools || undefined"
    fix: "Use enableTools != null for null checks on booleans"

  listener_leak:
    problem: "Tauri event listener never cleaned up on error path"
    cause: "No try/catch around invoke() after listen()"
    fix: "Always wrap invoke in try/catch that calls unlisten(). Add safety timeout."

  css_theme_variables:
    problem: "New CSS variable (--error) missing from some themes"
    cause: "Only added to 4/8 theme definitions"
    fix: "When adding CSS variable, check ALL 8 themes"

anti_patterns:
  - name: "Skip VERIFY"
    description: "Declaring done after tests pass but before building/running the app"
    fix: "VERIFY = actually build AND launch the app"

  - name: "Code first, test later"
    description: "Writing implementation before tests"
    fix: "TDD: test FIRST (RED), minimal code (GREEN), refactor"

  - name: "Single review"
    description: "Doing one code review and assuming everything is caught"
    fix: "3 rounds: CRITICAL → MEDIUM → SHOULD FIX"

  - name: "console.log debugging"
    description: "Using console.log/warn/error for debugging"
    fix: "Use structured Logger only"

  - name: "Trust falsy checks for booleans"
    description: "Using && or || with boolean values that can be false"
    fix: "Explicit null/undefined checks: value != null"
