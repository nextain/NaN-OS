Prompt: A high-quality 3D digital character named "Naia". The character has a minimalist, rounded humanoid body with cute cat-like ears. The entire body is made of a translucent, frosted glass (glassmorphism) material with a smooth, glossy finish. Inside the translucent body, subtle glowing Flow Cyan (#06B6D4) digital circuit patterns and micro-node networks are visible, emitting a soft light.

2. 세부 특징 (Specific Details)
Eyes & Face: Large, solid black glossy orb eyes with a tiny, minimalist "w" shaped cat mouth. No nose.

Hair (Optional): If hair is present, it should have a smooth, bob-style texture with a vibrant linear gradient from Nextain Blue (#2563EB) to Evolution Green (#10B981), with a glowing holographic sheen.

Emblems: A glowing cyan equilateral triangle logo with nodes at each vertex (the NaN OS logo) floats consistently above the head as a halo. The same logo and the text "Naia" are etched in glowing cyan on the center of the chest.

3. 레퍼런스 시트 구성 (Reference Sheet Style)
Prompt for Variation: A character reference sheet of Naia. It includes three views: Front, Side, and Back. In the back view, the character has a thin, translucent cat tail.
